# Genetic-Project
 
 Implemented a binary encoded genetic algorithm and used it to solve a multi-dimensional knapsack problem.
 Used that for feature selection in Linear Regression to improve the performance by reducing dimensionality.
 Improved the overall performance of the algorithm by using single-point crossover and adaptive mutation.
